# Digitization project: Grekernas och Romarnes Mytologi

This is the repository for my digitization project for the course 'Digitising Cultural Heritage Materials' at the University of BorÃ¥s. For this project I have digitized the book <i>Hufvuddragen af grekernas och romarnes mytologi by Hugo Bergstedt</i> from 1894. On the published site there is information about the project, the book and its author as well as a link to download a pdf-version of the digital copy of the book. My goal with this project have been to, with the help of digitization, preserve and make available the book in a digital form so that readers can interact with the content in the same way as they would with a physical copy. Therefore, I have provided a machine readable pdf-file so that readers can highlight, search or in other ways interact with the text. 
OBS! As the book is in Swedish both the content and the webiste is in Swedish.
